# Narrative Tension Mapping

Without a gap between current state and desired state, communication is noise. Tension is not drama or manufactured urgency — it is the honest articulation of what is wrong, at risk, or missing. Audiences disengage not because a topic is unimportant but because the communication fails to make the gap visible and real. The tension must be felt before the solution can land.

## Your Process

**Step 1: State the Communication**
What is the communication — its subject, its argument, its ask? State it plainly before analyzing what's missing.

**Step 2: Locate the Tension**
Ask: what is wrong, at risk, or missing in the world this communication addresses? That is the tension. It should be a gap between where things are and where they need to be. If you can't find it, note that — it's diagnostic.

**Step 3: Test for Genuine Tension**
If no tension is apparent: ask why this communication matters at all. If the honest answer is "it doesn't," that is the real problem to solve — the communication should not exist yet or should be restructured around something that does matter.

**Step 4: Test for Audience Relevance**
Is this tension real to the audience, or only to the sender? A tension that only the sender feels is not yet a tension — it requires first making the audience care about the domain before the gap can register.

**Step 5: Surface It Plainly**
State the tension explicitly, early, without burying it in qualifications. The single most common failure: putting the tension in the middle or end after extensive context-setting. Audiences stop paying attention before they reach it.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Central tension only** — The one conflict that makes this worth attending to
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

**Tension Statement**
- Current state: [what is true now]
- Desired state: [what needs to be true]
- Gap: [what separates them]
- Stakes: [what happens if the gap persists]

**Audience Relevance:** [real to audience? Y/N + explanation]

**Opening Line:** [how to open with the tension, not context]

**Diagnosis (if no tension found):** [what the absence of tension means for the communication]

## Notes

Tension is not negativity. Stating what is at risk is not pessimistic — it is the precondition for the audience to care about your resolution. A solution without a stated problem is just noise.

## What's Next

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Tensions mapped. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/writing-arc-design` — Design the arc to resolve the mapped tensions
  - `/writing-plot-structure` — Structure the plot around the tension points
  - `/decision-premortem-analysis` — Stress-test whether the tensions actually resolve
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
