# Temporal Timing Analysis

Timing is often as consequential as the decision itself. The right action at the wrong time fails — too early before conditions are ready, too late after the window has closed. Most timing judgments are made implicitly, with the urgency of the moment substituting for analysis. Making timing explicit means identifying which conditions are present, which are absent, and whether the environment is moving toward or away from readiness.

## Your Process

**Step 1: State the Action and Current Context**
Name the action under consideration and describe current conditions — market, organizational, political, technical. The timing analysis is grounded in this specific context.

**Step 2: Identify Readiness Conditions**
What observable conditions would make this optimal timing? These are specific and external — not "when we're ready" but "when X is true in the environment". For each condition: is it currently present or absent?

**Step 3: Assess Momentum**
Is the environment moving toward or away from ideal conditions? A missing condition that is approaching matters differently from one that is receding. Momentum changes the urgency calculation.

**Step 4: Cost of Waiting**
What is lost or foregone per unit of delay? Is the window closing — and how fast? Are competitors moving? Is the opportunity time-limited? Quantify where possible.

**Step 5: Cost of Acting Early**
What risks come from moving before conditions are right? First-mover disadvantage, resource waste, organizational fatigue from premature initiatives, credibility cost of a failed early attempt.

**Step 6: Define Trigger Signals**
What specific observable events should prompt action? These make timing a decision rule rather than a repeated judgment call.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Timing verdict only** — Act, wait, or prepare — and the single most important reason why
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

**Readiness Conditions**

| Condition | Present? | Momentum (toward / away) |
|-----------|---------|--------------------------|
| | | |

**Cost of Waiting:** [what is lost per period of delay; is the window closing?]

**Cost of Acting Early:** [risks of premature action]

**Timing Recommendation:** [act now / wait / prepare now, act at trigger] + rationale

**Trigger Signals:** [specific observable events that should prompt action]

## Notes

If both costs (waiting and acting early) are high, the situation requires a staged approach — begin preparation now, commit fully at the trigger. Identify what preparation can happen safely before the trigger is reached.
