# Power Mapping

Org charts describe formal authority. Power is different. It includes informal influence (whose opinion shifts decisions), gatekeeping (who controls access), and expertise (whose knowledge others depend on). A proposal that ignores actual power distribution will fail even if it is correct.

## Your Process

**Step 1: List Relevant Actors**
Name every person, role, or group that could affect or be affected by the situation. Include those who seem peripheral — they are sometimes the most important.

**Step 2: Map Each Actor Across Four Power Dimensions**
- **Formal authority** — what can they officially decide or approve?
- **Informal influence** — who listens to them? Whose decisions do they shape?
- **Gatekeeping** — what access, resources, or information do they control?
- **Expertise** — what knowledge gives them authority that others defer to?

**Step 3: Map Influence Flows**
Who influences whom? Who defers to whom in practice (which may differ significantly from the org chart)? Draw or describe the actual influence network.

**Step 4: Find Power Gaps**
Who needs to be on board but hasn't been engaged? Who could block progress but hasn't been considered? These are vulnerabilities in any plan.

**Step 5: Identify Invisible Stakeholders**
Who is affected by the situation but holds little or no power to shape it? Their interests may need explicit protection.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Informal power only** — Influence not visible in the formal structure
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

### Actor Inventory
| Actor | Formal Authority | Informal Influence | Gatekeeping | Expertise Power |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Influence Map
Describe the key influence flows: who shapes whom, where deference occurs, and where the org chart diverges from practice.

### Power Gaps
- [Actor who needs to be engaged but hasn't been — and why they matter]

### Invisible / Excluded Stakeholders
- [Affected parties without power — note whether their interests need explicit advocacy]

## Notes

Update the power map when the situation changes significantly — power is not static. The most important finding is usually the gap between the org chart and actual influence.
