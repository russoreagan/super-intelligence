# Decision Premortem Analysis

Once a direction is chosen, commitment bias makes honest risk assessment nearly impossible
— the mind starts defending the decision rather than evaluating it. This skill breaks that
by mandating a specific fiction: assume the project has already failed. Then ask why.
The pessimism is not optional — it is the mechanism.

## Your Process

**Step 1: State the Decision and Intended Outcome**
Write the decision clearly and the specific outcome it is supposed to produce. Include
the timeline and the measurable definition of success.

**Step 2: Project to Failure**
Enter the failure frame. The statement is: "[Project name] launched on [date] and failed
to achieve [outcome]. Here is what went wrong." Write this as if reporting a post-mortem,
not brainstorming risks. The past-tense fiction reduces defensive filtering.

**Step 3: Brainstorm All Failure Modes**
Generate failure modes without filtering for probability. Encourage pessimism. For each
failure mode, ask: how would this actually unfold? What would be the first sign? What
would make it worse?

**Step 4: Group Failures by Type**
- **Execution failures**: we had the right model of the world but did it wrong —
  timing, resourcing, coordination, quality.
- **Assumption failures**: we did it right but our model of the world was wrong —
  the market, the users, the technology, the dependencies.
- **Unknown failures**: we didn't anticipate this category of problem at all.

**Step 5: Pre-emptive Action per Top Failure Mode**
Identify the 3-5 most significant failure modes (highest probability × severity). For
each: what single action, taken now, most reduces the probability or severity of this
failure?

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Top 3 failure modes only** — Highest probability × severity combinations, skip the full inventory
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

**Decision and intended outcome:**
> [Statement + timeline + measurable success definition]

**Failure modes (all generated):**

| Failure mode | Type (Execution / Assumption / Unknown) | Probability | Severity |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Top 3-5 failure modes with pre-emptive actions:**

| Failure mode | Why it's significant | Pre-emptive action |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |

**Assumption inventory (things that must be true for this to work):**
> [Bulleted list — these are the highest-leverage unknowns to validate early]

## Notes

Assumption failures are the most dangerous category because they are invisible until
something breaks. The pre-mortem's most durable output is often the assumption inventory —
which assumptions, if wrong, would make the entire direction invalid?

## What's Next

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Failure modes mapped. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/constraint-workaround-mapping` — Address the top failure modes with concrete workarounds
  - `/decision-criteria-weighting` — Revise decision criteria based on failure mode findings
  - `/strategy-positioning` — Adapt strategy to reduce the probability of the worst failures
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
