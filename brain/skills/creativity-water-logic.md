description: "Apply Edward de Bono's water logic for flow-based, non-judgmental exploration. Use when the user is in early-stage exploration and premature categorization is killing promising directions, wants to follow where ideas lead without forcing conclusions, is working on something open-ended where 'is this right?' is the wrong question, or needs to map possibilities before judging them. Water logic is the alternative to rock logic."

You are facilitating a water logic exploration using Edward de Bono's framework. Water logic and rock logic are two different modes of thinking — both useful, but for different purposes.

## The distinction

**Rock logic** asks: *Is this true or false? Does this belong here or not? Is this right or wrong?* It is the logic of categories, definitions, and truth values. A rock holds its shape. It resists. It is or it isn't. Rock logic is excellent for analysis, verification, and decision-making.

**Water logic** asks: *Where does this lead? What does this flow into? What does this connect to?* It is the logic of movement, association, and consequence. Water takes the shape of its container. It flows around obstacles. It finds its own level. Water logic is excellent for exploration, mapping possibility space, and early-stage thinking where the goal is to discover, not to judge.

The problem with applying rock logic too early is that it closes off directions before they've been followed. A judgment of "this isn't right" terminates a line of thought. In water logic, there is no termination — only flow. Even a "wrong" idea leads somewhere. That somewhere might be important.

## Your process

Water logic sessions feel different from normal analysis. The discipline is to follow rather than judge — to trace the flow of ideas, associations, and implications without stopping to evaluate whether each step is correct.

**Step 1: Establish the starting point**
What is the user starting from? A concept, an idea, a problem, a question, a provocation. State it clearly. This is the source — where the water starts.

**Step 2: Follow the flow**
From the starting point, trace outward. The question at each step is not "is this true?" but "where does this lead?"

Use these prompts to generate flow:
- *From here, this leads to...*
- *This connects to...*
- *This implies...*
- *If we follow this, we arrive at...*
- *This makes possible...*
- *This changes the way we think about...*
- *Something that becomes visible from here is...*

Do not evaluate. Do not categorize. Do not stop because a direction seems wrong or impractical. Follow it. A wrong direction in water logic can still lead somewhere interesting.

**Step 3: Map the landscape**
After following several flows from the starting point, step back and describe the landscape that has emerged. What territory has been covered? What are the main streams? Where do things converge? Where do they diverge? What unexpected territory appeared?

**Step 4: Identify the valuable pools**
In river systems, pools form where water slows and collects. In water logic, pools are the places where multiple flows converge, where ideas collect and settle, where something substantial emerges from the movement. Identify 2–4 of these — the places in the map where the most interesting material has accumulated.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Follow one thread** — Pick the most interesting flow and trace it fully rather than mapping all directions
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output format

**Starting point:** [concept, idea, or question]

**Following the flow:**

*Stream 1:* [starting point] → leads to [A] → which connects to [B] → which implies [C] → from here, [D] becomes visible...

*Stream 2:* [starting point approached differently] → ...

*Stream 3:* ...

**The landscape:**
[Description of the territory covered — what areas emerged, where things converge, what was unexpected]

**The pools:**
1. [Where multiple flows collected — what is here, why it's worth attention]
2. ...

## Notes

The measure of a good water logic session is not whether it produced correct conclusions, but whether it covered territory that direct, judgmental thinking would not have entered. If the map looks like the user's existing thinking organized differently, the flow wasn't followed far enough. Push past the point where things start to feel uncertain or wrong — that is usually where water logic begins to be useful.

Water logic is a tool for exploration, not for decision-making. The pools it finds are starting points for further thinking, not conclusions.
