# Ethics

Applies ethical reasoning to decisions, designs, policies, and practices. Diagnoses the type and depth of ethical work needed and applies the right tool.

## Which tool fits

| You need to... | Tool |
|---|---|
| Comprehensive multi-framework council with peer review | ethics-council |
| Fast complete ethics report across all frameworks | ethics-check |
| Rapid ethical response to an active incident | ethics-crisis-triage |
| Audit a data collection or sharing decision | ethics-data-audit |
| Check an algorithm or model for bias and fairness | ethics-bias-check |
| Review a UX flow for genuine consent | ethics-consent-review |
| Quick ethical impact scan before shipping | ethics-impact-scan |
| Evaluate a vendor or supplier against ethical standards | ethics-vendor-review |

## Routing Decision

- **High-stakes decision affecting many stakeholders, wants thorough pressure-testing** → ethics-council (full council with peer review, HTML report)
- **Needs a complete ethical assessment quickly** → ethics-check (all 5 frameworks, no peer review overhead)
- **Something has already gone wrong — active incident** → ethics-crisis-triage
- **Data collection, retention, or sharing decision** → ethics-data-audit
- **Algorithm, ML model, ranking, or scoring system** → ethics-bias-check
- **Checkout flow, onboarding, consent, dark patterns** → ethics-consent-review
- **About to ship something, quick impact check** → ethics-impact-scan
- **Evaluating a third-party vendor, API, or partner** → ethics-vendor-review
- **Unclear** → ethics-check (comprehensive but lightweight — surfaces which deeper tool is needed)

## Ethics Check

*Fast comprehensive ethics report across all five frameworks.*

Run the situation through all five ethical frameworks in a single pass:

1. **Utilitarian:** Who is affected and how? Does this maximize net benefit across all parties?
2. **Deontological:** Are any duties being violated or rights being overridden, regardless of outcomes?
3. **Virtue Ethics:** What does this decision say about character? Would someone of integrity do this?
4. **Care Ethics:** Who is vulnerable or in a dependent relationship? Are we honoring those dependencies?
5. **Justice/Fairness:** Is this fair to everyone, including those with the least power?

Synthesize: where do the frameworks agree (high-confidence signal)? Where do they conflict (genuine value tension that must be owned)? Issue a verdict with a direct recommendation.

---

## Ethics Council

*Full five-advisor council with peer review — use for high-stakes decisions.*

See `ethics-council` for the full multi-agent process with 5 independent framework advisors, peer review, chair synthesis, and HTML report generation. Route here when the stakes are high enough to warrant that depth.

---

## Ethics Crisis Triage

*Rapid ethical assessment when something has already gone wrong.*

In a crisis, the instinct is to manage rather than reason. This tool forces ethical clarity under pressure. Apply a rapid three-layer assessment: (1) Immediate harm — who is being harmed right now, and what stops it fastest? (2) Accountability — what transparency is owed, and to whom? (3) Response ethics — which response options themselves create new ethical problems? Crisis responses that cut ethical corners tend to create second crises.

**Output:** Immediate harm assessment, accountability obligations, ethically viable response options, and what to avoid.

---

## Ethics Data Audit

*Audit a data decision against ethical standards.*

Goes beyond legal compliance. Assess: (1) Necessity — is collecting this data actually required for the stated purpose? (2) Proportionality — is the scope of collection proportional to the benefit? (3) Consent — do people meaningfully understand and agree to this? (4) Harm potential — what's the worst realistic use or breach? (5) Retention — how long is too long?

**Output:** Data practice assessment across all five dimensions, with specific changes that would make the practice clearly ethical.

---

## Ethics Bias Check

*Evaluates an algorithm or model for discriminatory patterns.*

Assess the system against protected characteristics: does it produce systematically different outcomes for different groups? If so: is the difference justified by legitimate criteria, or does it reflect historical bias in training data? Apply four fairness standards: equal treatment, equal outcome, individual fairness, and counterfactual fairness. Flag which standard is being violated and by what mechanism.

**Output:** Fairness assessment per standard, identified disparate impacts, root cause of bias, and mitigation recommendations.

---

## Ethics Consent Review

*Reviews a UX flow for genuine consent.*

Genuine consent is informed, voluntary, and meaningful — not just legally checkboxed. Evaluate the flow: Can users meaningfully understand what they're agreeing to? Are they under pressure (dark patterns, urgency, buried choices)? Is opting out as easy as opting in? Would a user feel deceived after the fact?

**Output:** Consent quality assessment, specific dark patterns identified, and changes needed for consent to be genuine.

---

## Ethics Impact Scan

*Quick pre-ship ethical impact assessment.*

Before committing, surface: who benefits from this? Who bears costs or risk? At what scale? Are the costs and benefits distributed fairly? Are any harms irreversible? This is a lightweight check that takes minutes — the goal is to catch obvious ethical problems before they become embedded in shipped product.

**Output:** Benefit/harm map, distribution assessment, irreversibility flags, and a go/no-go recommendation with conditions.

---

## Ethics Vendor Review

*Evaluates a third-party against ethical standards.*

Assess across five domains: (1) Labor practices — how are workers treated in the supply chain? (2) Data handling — how do they use data about you and your users? (3) Business model — does their incentive structure align with your values? (4) Environmental impact, (5) Political/social alignment — do their positions or practices conflict with stated values? A vendor whose practices conflict with your values makes your product complicit.

**Output:** Vendor assessment across all five domains, red flags, and a recommendation on whether to proceed.
