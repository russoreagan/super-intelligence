# Temporal Cycle Detection

Every situation that feels unprecedented is usually an instance of a recurring cycle. Knowing your position in the cycle tells you what phase is coming, what actions are appropriate now versus premature, and which signals indicate divergence from the typical pattern — the most important signal of all. Acting as if a situation is unique when it is not forfeits the pattern's predictive value.

## Your Process

**Step 1: Describe Current State and Trajectory**
State what is happening now and how the situation has moved over the past period. Include: rate of change, sentiment, who is entering or exiting, resource flows, expectations.

**Step 2: Match to a Candidate Cycle**
Compare against the most common cycles:
- **Technology Hype Cycle (Gartner):** trigger → peak of inflated expectations → trough of disillusionment → slope of enlightenment → plateau of productivity
- **Product Adoption Curve (Rogers):** innovators → early adopters → early majority → late majority → laggards
- **Business/Economic Cycle:** expansion → peak → contraction → trough → recovery
- **Organisational Change Curve (Kübler-Ross adapted):** shock → denial → frustration → depression → experiment → decision → integration
- **Competitive Cycle:** emergence → growth → shakeout → maturity → decline/renewal
- **Market Cycle:** accumulation → markup → distribution → markdown

**Step 3: Map Current Position**
Place the situation on the curve. Be specific about which phase and where within the phase (early, mid, late).

**Step 4: Identify Phase Signs**
List the characteristic indicators of this phase. Which are present? Which are absent? Absent expected signs are as informative as present ones.

**Step 5: State the Typical Next Phase**
What normally follows this phase? What are the leading indicators that the transition has begun?

**Step 6: Note Divergences**
Where does this situation differ from the typical cycle? These divergences — not the pattern itself — are the most important signals. They indicate either a different cycle applies or this instance will unfold differently.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Current position only** — Where in the cycle we are right now, skip the full cycle description
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

**Cycle Match:** [cycle name] — [why it fits]

**Current Position:** [phase name] — [early / mid / late within phase]

**Phase Signs**

| Expected Sign for This Phase | Present? |
|------------------------------|---------|
| | |

**Typical Next Phase:** [name + leading indicators of transition]

**Divergences:** [where this instance differs from the typical pattern + what that implies]

**Implications:** [what actions are appropriate now vs. premature vs. overdue]

## Notes

If no cycle fits well, that is itself a finding — either the situation is genuinely novel or it requires a composite of two cycles. Name the mismatch explicitly rather than forcing a fit.

## What's Next

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Cycles detected. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/historical-cycle-detection` — Look for historical evidence that confirms the cycles
  - `/temporal-timing-analysis` — Time actions to the detected cycles
  - `/strategy-timing` — Align strategy with the cycle timing
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
