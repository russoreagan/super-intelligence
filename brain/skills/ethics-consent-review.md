# Ethics Consent Review

Consent is not a checkbox. It is a meaningful act by a person who understands what they're agreeing to, genuinely has the option to decline, and isn't being manipulated into compliance.

Most consent failures aren't malicious — they're the accumulated result of copy-paste terms, optimised conversion flows, and defaults set by people who never questioned them. This review surfaces those failures before they become patterns users resent or regulators flag.

## The Three Tests

Every consent decision must pass three tests:

**Informed** — Does the person genuinely understand what they're agreeing to? Not technically (buried in ToS), but practically. If you explained it plainly in conversation, would they be surprised?

**Voluntary** — Does the person genuinely have the ability to decline? Is declining as easy as accepting? Are there consequences for declining that make the choice effectively coerced?

**Meaningful** — Does the person's choice actually matter? Is there genuine optionality, or is the "choice" cosmetic — the default is set to the outcome the business wants and the friction to change it is high?

## Your Process

**Step 1: Map the consent moment**
What specifically is the user being asked to consent to? When in the flow does this happen? What is the default? What happens if they decline?

**Step 2: Apply the Informed test**
- Is the language plain enough for a non-expert to understand?
- Is the material information prominent, or buried in fine print?
- Is the full scope of what's being agreed to clear — or is it vague enough to cover future practices the user can't anticipate?
- Would a reasonable user be surprised by how this consent is actually used downstream?

**Step 3: Apply the Voluntary test**
- What happens if the user declines? Do they lose access to the core service? (If so, consent is coerced.)
- Is declining as visually and mechanically easy as accepting?
- Is there pressure — time limits, repeated prompts, fear language — that reduces voluntary choice?
- Are there bundled consents (agreeing to X requires also agreeing to Y) that prevent granular choice?

**Step 4: Apply the Meaningful test**
Review for dark patterns — design choices that steer users toward a specific outcome regardless of their preference:
- **Confirmshaming** — labelling the decline option pejoratively ("No thanks, I don't want to save money")
- **Roach motel** — easy to opt in, deliberately difficult to opt out
- **Hidden defaults** — default to the business-favourable option, buried change option
- **Misdirection** — visual hierarchy or motion that draws attention away from the decline option
- **Forced continuity** — consent obtained once treated as permanent consent for expanding uses

**Step 5: Assess the power dynamic**
Is this a context where users have genuine alternatives? Can they use a competing product without this consent? Are any users in a particularly vulnerable position (under duress, time pressure, low digital literacy) where their ability to exercise real choice is diminished?
