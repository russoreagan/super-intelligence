# Mindset

Applies deep philosophy-grade thinking orientations to life, work, and challenge. Diagnoses what kind of mindset work is needed and routes to the right tool — whether that's learning to distinguish what's in your control, building genuine flourishing, shifting how you relate to failure, restructuring a thought distortion, or designing conditions for optimal experience.

## Which tool fits

| You need to... | Tool |
|---|---|
| Deal with what you can't control; stop worrying about outcomes; find equanimity | mindset-stoic |
| Build more flourishing and wellbeing; understand what's missing in your life | mindset-positive |
| Stop treating failure like it means something about you; develop in areas you find hard | mindset-growth |
| Get out of a negative thought loop; generate more accurate interpretations | mindset-reframe |
| Get into deep focus and flow; design conditions for optimal experience | mindset-flow |

## Routing Decision

- **"I keep worrying about outcomes / things I can't control"** → mindset-stoic (the dichotomy of control is the entry point)
- **"I'm not thriving / I want more wellbeing / something feels missing"** → mindset-positive (PERMA diagnosis)
- **"I keep treating failure like it means something about me"** / **"I hate not being good at things yet"** → mindset-growth (fixed-mindset trigger identification)
- **"I'm stuck in a negative thought loop"** / **"I keep interpreting this the worst way"** / **"I can't stop catastrophizing"** → mindset-reframe (cognitive distortion mapping)
- **"I can't focus"** / **"I want to get into deep work"** / **"I used to experience flow and don't anymore"** → mindset-flow (flow channel diagnosis)
- **Unclear** → mindset-reframe (starts with the thought, which surfaces which deeper orientation is needed)

## Stoic

*The full Stoic toolkit: identify what's in your control, apply the right practice, reframe from first principles.*

The Stoic tradition — Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca — offers the most developed framework for distinguishing what is "up to us" (judgments, desires, actions) from what is not (body, reputation, outcomes, others). The skill encodes four core practices: negative visualization, amor fati, memento mori, and the view from above. Process: identify the situation → isolate what is and isn't in your control → apply the relevant practice → articulate the Stoic reframe.

## Positive Psychology

*Diagnose which dimension of flourishing is underdeveloped and apply the right evidence-based intervention.*

Based on Seligman's PERMA model (Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment) and the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions. Distinguishes genuine flourishing from toxic positivity. Process: PERMA audit → diagnosis → targeted intervention for the underdeveloped dimension.

## Growth Mindset

*Identify the fixed-mindset trigger, surface the hidden belief, and design the learning response.*

Based on Carol Dweck's research — the actual mechanics, not the pop version. Fixed mindset treats abilities as fixed traits; growth mindset treats them as developable capacities. Process: identify the fixed-mindset trigger (challenge, failure, comparison) → surface the hidden fixed-mindset belief → reframe through the growth lens → design a concrete learning response.

---

## Reframe

*Map the cognitive distortion and generate a more accurate interpretation.*

Based on CBT cognitive restructuring. The cognitive triangle: thoughts → feelings → behaviors. Core process: identify the automatic thought → examine evidence for and against → name the cognitive distortion → generate an alternative interpretation equally consistent with the facts but more useful. Not about forced positivity — about accuracy.

---

## Flow

*Diagnose why flow isn't occurring and redesign the conditions for optimal experience.*

Based on Csikszentmihalyi's flow framework. Flow requires: clear goals, immediate feedback, and challenge/skill balance. Process: identify the target activity → audit what's blocking flow (wrong challenge/skill ratio? absent feedback? unclear goals? interruptions?) → redesign the conditions → enter the flow channel.
