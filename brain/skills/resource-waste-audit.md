# Resource Waste Audit

In manufacturing, Toyota identified seven categories of waste. They apply equally to knowledge work — with a different surface appearance but the same underlying structure. The goal is to find where resources are consumed without producing value.

## The Seven Wastes in Knowledge Work

| Waste | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Waiting** | Idle time between steps — work blocked pending a decision, review, or dependency |
| **Overproduction** | Producing more than is needed — reports no one reads, features no one uses |
| **Rework** | Fixing what should have been right — re-doing work due to unclear requirements or poor handoffs |
| **Duplication** | The same work being done in two places — parallel efforts, re-discovered knowledge |
| **Motion** | Unnecessary switching or handoffs — context switching, excessive meetings, process overhead |
| **Inventory** | Work in progress that is not flowing — large backlogs, features built but not shipped |
| **Over-processing** | More effort than the task requires — over-engineered solutions, unnecessary polish |

## Your Process

**Step 1: Map the Workflow or Resource Allocation**
Describe how work moves through the system — the full path from input to value delivery.

**Step 2: Scan Each Waste Category**
For each of the seven wastes: where does it appear in the workflow? Look for specific instances, not general impressions.

**Step 3: Quantify Each Waste**
Estimate roughly how much resource each waste consumes — time per week, headcount, or percentage of capacity. Rough estimates are fine; the goal is to rank, not to audit precisely.

**Step 4: Root Cause per Waste**
Why does this waste exist? Process design? Incentive structure? Unclear ownership? Identifying the root cause determines whether the fix is simple or systemic.

**Step 5: Rank by Impact and Recommend**
Which waste removal would free the most resource? Prioritise the top three and propose specific actions.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Biggest waste items only** — Top 3 losses by magnitude, skip smaller inefficiencies
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

### Waste Inventory
| Waste Type | Where It Appears | Estimated Resource Cost | Root Cause |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|------------|
| Waiting | ... | ... | ... |
| Overproduction | ... | ... | ... |
| Rework | ... | ... | ... |
| Duplication | ... | ... | ... |
| Motion | ... | ... | ... |
| Inventory | ... | ... | ... |
| Over-processing | ... | ... | ... |

### Top 3 Waste Reductions (Ranked by Impact)
1. **[Waste type]** — [Specific action] — [Expected resource freed]
2. **[Waste type]** — [Specific action] — [Expected resource freed]
3. **[Waste type]** — [Specific action] — [Expected resource freed]

## Notes

Rework and duplication are usually the most expensive wastes in knowledge work, but waiting is often the most demoralising. Address the highest-cost waste first, but don't ignore the one most affecting morale.

## What's Next

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Waste audited. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/resource-allocation-analysis` — Reallocate resources freed by eliminating waste
  - `/resource-leverage-mapping` — Reinvest freed capacity into high-leverage areas
  - `/decision-criteria-weighting` — Weight decisions after waste is removed from the picture
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
