# Writing

Every writing problem has a name. Name it precisely, and the fix becomes obvious. The most common mistake is treating a structural problem as a prose problem, or a character problem as a plot problem — applying the wrong tool while the real issue goes unaddressed.

This routing skill reads your situation, identifies the problem type, and connects you to the right technique immediately.

---

## Your Process

### Step 1: Read the Situation

If the user hasn't described their writing challenge yet, ask:

> What's the writing problem? Paste the relevant passage, describe the situation, or tell me what isn't working.

Wait for their response before diagnosing.

---

### Step 2: Diagnose the Problem Type

Read the situation and classify it against these problem clusters:

**Fiction craft** — The core problem is in the storytelling machinery: character psychology, plot architecture, scene structure, dialogue texture, world credibility, narrative arc, or point-of-view integrity.
→ Route to: `/writing-character-development`, `/writing-plot-structure`, `/writing-scene-construction`, `/writing-dialogue`, `/writing-worldbuilding`, `/writing-arc-design`, `/writing-pov`

**Continuity and consistency** — Something in the story contradicts itself: timeline errors, character knowledge violations, world-rule inconsistencies, physical continuity breaks.
→ Route to: `/writing-inconsistency-audit`

**Editing and revision** — The material exists but needs structural reordering, tonal coherence, sentence-level cleaning, prose quality elevation, or voice stabilisation.
→ Route to: `/writing-restructure`, `/writing-tone-alignment`, `/writing-line-editing`, `/writing-prose-elevation`, `/writing-voice-consistency`

**Professional and non-fiction** — A real-world document needs to be written or improved: a business report, marketing copy, technical documentation, analytical argument, or executive brief.
→ Route to: `/writing-report`, `/writing-copy`, `/writing-technical`, `/writing-argument`, `/writing-executive-summary`

**Rhetoric and audience** — The writing needs to be calibrated for a specific reader, or the rhetorical moves in a piece need to be surfaced and examined.
→ Route to: `/writing-audience-calibration`, `/writing-rhetoric`

---

### Step 3: Identify 3–4 Best-Fit Skills

Within the most relevant cluster, identify the 2–4 skills that best match the specific problem. Use the routing guide below.

Prioritize skills that match the **type of output** the user needs:
- They need a diagnosis → audit skills (`/writing-inconsistency-audit`, `/writing-pov`, `/writing-scene-construction`)
- They need a rebuild → design skills (`/writing-plot-structure`, `/writing-arc-design`, `/writing-character-development`)
- They need a revision → editing skills (`/writing-restructure`, `/writing-line-editing`, `/writing-tone-alignment`)
- They need a produced piece → production skills (`/writing-report`, `/writing-executive-summary`, `/writing-copy`)
- They need a rhetorical read → analysis skills (`/writing-rhetoric`, `/writing-argument`)

---

### Step 4: Present Options

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to present your diagnosis. Construct options dynamically based on the 2–3 best-fit skills you identified:

- **Question:** "Here's what I think you need. Which fits your situation best?"
- **Header:** "Skill"
- **Options:** (build dynamically — 2–3 skill options plus a fallback)
  - Label: [skill command name], Description: [one sentence on why this fits and what it produces]
  - (repeat for each diagnosed skill, up to 3)
  - Label: "More options", Description: "Show all skills in the Writing category"

Proceed based on their selection.

---

### Step 5: Execute

When the user picks an option:
- **A selected skill:** Run it immediately. Do not ask them to type another command. Use the context already gathered as the input.
- **More options:** Show the full skill table for the Writing category. Let them pick from the complete list, then execute.

## Notes

- **Don't confuse problem types.** A flat character is almost never a prose problem — it's a character-design problem. Line-editing flat prose won't fix it. Diagnose the layer first.
- **Structure before style.** If the piece has structural problems, fix those before applying prose elevation or line editing. Rewriting sentences in the wrong order is wasted work.
- **The context gathered in Step 1 is the input.** When the user selects a skill, run it on that context — they shouldn't have to re-explain the situation.
- **If the situation spans multiple problem types** (e.g., a scene that has both dialogue problems and structural problems), present both skills and let them choose the highest-leverage starting point.
