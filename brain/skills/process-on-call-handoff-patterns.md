# On-Call Handoff Patterns

Effective patterns for on-call shift transitions, ensuring continuity, context transfer, and reliable incident response across shifts.

## When to Use This Skill

- Transitioning on-call responsibilities
- Writing shift handoff summaries
- Documenting ongoing investigations
- Establishing on-call rotation procedures
- Improving handoff quality
- Onboarding new on-call engineers

## Core Concepts

### 1. Handoff Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Active Incidents** | What's currently broken |
| **Ongoing Investigations** | Issues being debugged |
| **Recent Changes** | Deployments, configs |
| **Known Issues** | Workarounds in place |
| **Upcoming Events** | Maintenance, releases |

### 2. Handoff Timing

```
Recommended: 30 min overlap between shifts

Outgoing:
├── 15 min: Write handoff document
└── 15 min: Sync call with incoming

Incoming:
├── 15 min: Review handoff document
├── 15 min: Sync call with outgoing
└── 5 min: Verify alerting setup
```

## Templates

### Template 1: Shift Handoff Document

```markdown
# On-Call Handoff: Platform Team

**Outgoing**: @alice (2024-01-15 to 2024-01-22)
**Incoming**: @bob (2024-01-22 to 2024-01-29)
**Handoff Time**: 2024-01-22 09:00 UTC

## 🔴 Active Incidents

### None currently active
No active incidents at handoff time.

## 🟡 Ongoing Investigations

### 1. Intermittent API Timeouts (ENG-1234)
**Status**: Investigating
**Started**: 2024-01-20
**Impact**: ~0.1% of requests timing out

**Context**:
- Timeouts correlate with database backup window (02:00-03:00 UTC)
- Suspect backup process causing lock contention
- Added extra logging in PR #567 (deployed 01/21)

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Review new logs after tonight's backup
- [ ] Consider moving backup window if confirmed

**Resources**:
- Dashboard: [API Latency](https://grafana/d/api-latency)
- Thread: #platform-eng (01/20, 14:32)

### 2. Memory Growth in Auth Service (ENG-1235)
**Status**: Monitoring
**Started**: 2024-01-18
**Impact**: None yet (proactive)

**Context**:
- Memory usage growing ~5% per day
- No memory leak found in profiling
- Suspect connection pool not releasing properly

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Review heap dump from 01/21
- [ ] Consider restart if usage > 80%

**Resources**:
- Dashboard: [Auth Service Memory](https://grafana/d/auth-memory)
- Analysis doc: [Memory Investigation](https://docs/eng-1235)

## 🟢 Resolved This Shift

### Payment Service Outage (2024-01-19)
- **Duration**: 23 minutes
- **Root Cause**: Database connection exhaustion
- **Resolution**: Rolled back v2.3.4, increased pool size
- **Postmortem**: [POSTMORTEM-89](https://docs/postmortem-89)
- **Follow-up tickets**: ENG-1230, ENG-1231
