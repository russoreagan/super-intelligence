# Decision Option Mapping

The options people choose between are usually not all the options that exist — they are
the first options that were named, which then anchored the frame. This skill expands the
option set before analysis begins, using four specific moves that reliably surface options
the natural framing excludes.

---

## Your Process

**Step 1: State the Decision and Currently-Considered Options**
Write the decision as currently framed and list all options currently on the table. Don't
filter yet — include the options even if they seem weak.

**Step 2: Challenge the Frame**
Is this decision actually forced? Are you choosing between options A and B because those
are the real options, or because those are the options that were generated first? What
would have to be true for there to be no decision to make?

**Step 3: Four Expansion Moves**

**(a) Expand**: Generate 3 more ways to achieve the underlying goal. Not variations on
existing options — genuinely different approaches. Ask: if none of the current options
existed, what would we try?

**(b) Defer**: Is "decide later" viable? At what cost? Deferral is a real option — it
has costs and benefits like any other. When can this be decided without foreclosing
anything important?

**(c) Hybrid**: Can elements of multiple options be combined? Hybrids often emerge when
options are treated as mutually exclusive when they aren't.

**(d) Reframe**: If the goal were slightly different, what options appear? Sometimes
the option set is limited by the goal framing, not the constraints.

**Step 4: Add Viable New Options**
From the four moves, add the options that are genuinely viable. Discard the ones that
don't survive basic scrutiny — not to narrow prematurely, but to keep the set useful.

**Step 5: Recommend Next Step**
With the expanded set, recommend which analytical tool to apply: decision-criteria-
weighting (multiple comparable options), decision-reversibility-analysis (one option being
considered), or decision-premortem-analysis (a direction already being leaned toward).

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Hidden options only** — Surface the options not currently being considered
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

**Decision as framed:** [Statement]
**Currently-considered options:** [List]

**Frame challenge:**
> [Is this decision forced? What assumptions are built into the current option set?]

**Expanded option set:**

| Option | Source (original / expand / defer / hybrid / reframe) | Viable? | Reason |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Options to add to the decision:**
> [Bulleted list with one-line rationale each]

**Recommended next step:**
> [Which analytical skill to apply, and to which expanded option set]

## Notes

The most commonly missed option is deferral. "Decide now" is itself a choice with costs —
urgency is often assumed rather than real, and deferral with a defined review point is
frequently the most rational option on the table.

## What's Next

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Options mapped. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/decision-criteria-weighting` — Evaluate the options you've mapped against weighted criteria
  - `/decision-premortem-analysis` — Stress-test the leading option before committing
  - `/probability-scenario-weighting` — Weight options by their probability of success
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
