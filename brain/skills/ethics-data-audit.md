Use when the user is making decisions about what data to collect, how long to keep it, who can access it, or who it's shared with. TRIGGERS: 'audit this data decision', 'is this data practice ok', 'data ethics check', any change to data models, privacy controls, analytics instrumentation, data sharing agreements, or retention policies. Goes beyond legal compliance — evaluates whether the practice is ethical, not just lawful."

# Ethics Data Audit

Legal compliance sets the floor. This audit asks whether your data practices clear a higher bar: are they *ethical*?

The distinction matters. GDPR-compliant practices can still be extractive. Lawful data collection can still violate trust. This audit evaluates data decisions through two lenses that legal frameworks tend to underweight: **deontological** (what do users have a right to, regardless of what the terms allow?) and **care ethics** (what do you owe the people whose data you hold, given the relationship and the vulnerability involved?).

## Your Process

**Step 1: Define the data practice**
What data is being collected, retained, shared, or used? Be specific: what fields, what volume, what purpose, who can access it, how long is it kept, where does it go?

**Step 2: Deontological Assessment — Rights and Duties**
Users have rights that don't disappear because they clicked "I agree." Examine:

- **Informed consent**: Do users genuinely understand what's being collected and why? Would they understand if you explained it plainly, without legal language?
- **Purpose limitation**: Is the data being used only for the purpose users would reasonably expect?
- **Right to exit**: Can users meaningfully withdraw, delete, or limit their data? Is that easy or deliberately difficult?
- **Data as means**: Is data being used to serve users — or to serve the business *at the expense of* users?

Flag any duty being violated, even if legally covered.

**Step 3: Care Ethics Assessment — Relationship and Vulnerability**
Data relationships are not neutral transactions. Examine:

- **Asymmetry**: The organisation knows vastly more about users than users know about the organisation. Does the practice exploit that asymmetry?
- **Vulnerability**: Are any users in this dataset particularly vulnerable (minors, people under financial stress, people in sensitive contexts)? Does the practice account for that?
- **Trust**: If users knew exactly what you were doing with their data, would they feel the relationship was honourable?
- **Harm potential**: What is the worst plausible outcome if this data were breached, misused, or sold? Who bears that harm?

**Step 4: Produce the audit**

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Consent and harm potential only** — Skip necessity, proportionality, and retention sections
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Notes

This audit does not replace legal review. It supplements it. A practice can pass this audit and still require legal sign-off. A practice that fails this audit should not be excused by legal compliance.

If the audit turns up significant concerns, consider escalating to `ethics-council` for a full multi-framework analysis.
