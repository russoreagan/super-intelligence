# Ethics Data Audit

Legal compliance sets the floor. This audit asks whether your data practices clear a higher bar: are they *ethical*?

The distinction matters. GDPR-compliant practices can still be extractive. Lawful data collection can still violate trust. This audit evaluates data decisions through two lenses that legal frameworks tend to underweight: **deontological** (what do users have a right to, regardless of what the terms allow?) and **care ethics** (what do you owe the people whose data you hold, given the relationship and the vulnerability involved?).

## Your Process

**Step 1: Define the data practice**
What data is being collected, retained, shared, or used? Be specific: what fields, what volume, what purpose, who can access it, how long is it kept, where does it go?

**Step 2: Deontological Assessment — Rights and Duties**
Users have rights that don't disappear because they clicked "I agree." Examine:

- **Informed consent**: Do users genuinely understand what's being collected and why? Would they understand if you explained it plainly, without legal language?
- **Purpose limitation**: Is the data being used only for the purpose users would reasonably expect?
- **Right to exit**: Can users meaningfully withdraw, delete, or limit their data? Is that easy or deliberately difficult?
- **Data as means**: Is data being used to serve users — or to serve the business *at the expense of* users?

Flag any duty being violated, even if legally covered.

**Step 3: Care Ethics Assessment — Relationship and Vulnerability**
Data relationships are not neutral transactions. Examine:

- **Asymmetry**: The organisation knows vastly more about users than users know about the organisation. Does the practice exploit that asymmetry?
- **Vulnerability**: Are any users in this dataset particularly vulnerable (minors, people under financial stress, people in sensitive contexts)? Does the practice account for that?
- **Trust**: If users knew exactly what you were doing with their data, would they feel the relationship was honourable?
- **Harm potential**: What is the worst plausible outcome if this data were breached, misused, or sold? Who bears that harm?

**Step 4: Produce the audit**

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Consent and harm potential only** — Skip necessity, proportionality, and retention sections
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.
