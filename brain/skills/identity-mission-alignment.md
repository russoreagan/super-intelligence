# Mission Alignment

Organisations drift from mission gradually — through decisions that are each individually justifiable but collectively represent a departure from purpose. The test is not whether a decision can be argued to be consistent with mission, but whether it genuinely serves it.

## Your Process

**Step 1: State the Mission Plainly**
Not the marketing version — the operational version. What is this organisation or person actually trying to achieve, for whom, and why? If the mission has multiple legitimate interpretations, name them.

**Step 2: State the Proposed Direction**
What is the decision, initiative, or direction being evaluated?

**Step 3: Test for Direct Mission Service**
Does this directly serve the mission? If yes: how specifically — trace the connection. If no: what is it serving instead (growth, revenue, opportunity, stakeholder pressure)?

**Step 4: Test for Rationalisation**
Does the case for alignment require interpreting the mission more broadly than it was intended? Is this a genuine evolution of the mission — or is the mission being stretched to justify an attractive decision that doesn't actually fit?

**Step 5: Apply the Genuine Pursuer Test**
What would someone who genuinely, single-mindedly pursued this mission do? Does the proposal match that behaviour? If a person fully committed to the mission looked at this decision, would they find it obvious — or would they feel something was off?

**Step 6: Classify and Recommend**
Assign a classification and make a recommendation.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Misalignment only** — Where this decision diverges from stated mission
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

### Mission Statement (Plain Version)
[Operational description — not the tagline]

### Proposed Decision
[Clear description]

### Direct Mission Service
**Directly serves mission:** Yes / Partially / No
**Connection (if yes):** [Specific trace from decision to mission outcome]
**What it's actually serving (if no):** [Honest description]

### Rationalisation Risk Assessment
Is the mission being stretched to justify this decision? What is the evidence for or against?

### Genuine Pursuer Test
What would someone fully committed to this mission do? Does the proposal fit?

### Classification and Recommendation
**Classification:** On-Mission / Adjacent / Off-Mission / Mission-Expanding
**Recommendation:** [Proceed / Proceed with modification / Pause / Decline — with rationale]

## Notes

"Adjacent" and "Mission-Expanding" are not the same thing — adjacent means close but not serving the mission, while mission-expanding means the mission is genuinely growing. Be precise about which applies.
