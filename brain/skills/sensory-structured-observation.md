# Structured Observation

Most observation is interpretation in disguise. We perceive a situation and instantly explain it — but the explanation overwrites the raw data. Structured observation forces a separation between what can be directly seen and what we conclude from it.

## Your Process

**Step 1: Define the Target and Time Boundary**
Name the exact thing being observed and the scope. What counts as inside this observation, and what is out of scope?

**Step 2: Separate Observation from Interpretation**
Write only what can be directly observed — no inferences, no attributions of intent or cause. "User clicked back immediately" not "user was confused." Flag every sentence that is actually an inference and set it aside.

**Step 3: Observe at Three Levels**
- **Events** — what is happening? Discrete, specific occurrences.
- **Patterns** — how is it happening? Recurring structure across events.
- **Absences** — what is not happening that might be expected?

**Step 4: Flag Surprising or Incongruent Observations**
What doesn't fit? Where does something contradict expectations? These are the most information-rich observations — prioritise them.

**Step 5: Generate Interpretations**
Only after completing Steps 2–4: generate multiple possible interpretations for each key observation. Aim for at least two competing explanations.

**Step 6: Identify the Most Testable Interpretation**
Which interpretation makes the most specific, falsifiable prediction? That is the one to act on first.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Initial observations only** — What's actually there before any interpretation is applied
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

### Observations
| Level | Observation (no interpretation) |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| Event | ... |
| Pattern | ... |
| Absence | ... |

### Surprising or Incongruent Observations
- List each, with a note on why it is surprising.

### Interpretations per Key Observation
| Observation | Interpretation A | Interpretation B |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| ... | ... | ... |

### Most Testable Interpretation
State it as a prediction: "If [interpretation] is correct, then [specific observable consequence]."

## Notes

Run this before diagnosis, analysis, or decision. The discipline has most value when you feel you already understand the situation — that feeling is usually a sign that interpretation has already overtaken observation.

## What's Next

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Observation complete. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/sensory-detail-mining` — Mine details from what structured observation revealed
  - `/sensory-signal-detection` — Detect signals in the observed
  - `/aesthetic-coherence-check` — Check coherence of what was observed
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
