# Ethics Impact Scan

A pre-ship ethical scan. Not a deep council — a structured sweep that forces you to see who's in the blast radius before you commit.

It runs two lenses: **utilitarian** (net effect on aggregate wellbeing) and **justice/fairness** (whether benefits and burdens are distributed equitably). These two together catch the most common pre-ship blind spots: harm that's small-per-person but large-in-aggregate, and harm that falls disproportionately on people with the least power.

## Your Process

**Step 1: Clarify the subject**
State what is being scanned — a feature, change, product decision, or policy. If the subject is vague, ask one clarifying question before proceeding.

**Step 2: Map the stakeholder field**
Before applying any lens, identify everyone affected:
- Direct users (who uses this feature and how?)
- Indirect parties (who is affected by users' use of this feature?)
- Third parties (suppliers, partners, communities)
- Non-users (people who don't opt in but are still affected)
- Future parties (people who will be affected by the precedent this sets)

Don't skip non-users and future parties. They are the most commonly missed.

**Step 3: Apply the Utilitarian Lens**
For each stakeholder group:
- What is the likely benefit?
- What is the likely harm?
- What is the scale (how many people, how significantly)?

Then: Is the net effect positive? Who bears disproportionate cost to generate that net positive?

**Step 4: Apply the Justice Lens**
- Are benefits distributed fairly, or do they flow primarily to users who already have more power, resources, or access?
- Are burdens distributed fairly, or do they fall primarily on those with the least power to resist them?
- Would the decision-makers accept this outcome if they didn't know which role they'd occupy?

**Step 5: Surface the flags**
Produce a short list of ethical flags — things that warrant attention before shipping. A flag is not a veto; it is a signal that deserves a conscious decision. Distinguish:
- 🔴 **Block** — this is a significant harm that should be resolved before shipping
- 🟡 **Watch** — this is a risk worth monitoring or mitigating, but not a blocker
- 🟢 **Note** — this is worth being aware of, but is low-risk

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Go/no-go verdict only** — Recommendation and top conditions, skip the benefit/harm map
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

**Subject:** [what is being scanned]

**Stakeholder Map**
| Stakeholder | Affected How | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| [group] | [benefit or harm] | [rough scale] |

**Utilitarian Assessment**
[2–3 sentences on net effect: who benefits, who's harmed, is the aggregate positive]

**Justice Assessment**
[2–3 sentences on distribution: are benefits and burdens equitably spread, who bears disproportionate cost]
