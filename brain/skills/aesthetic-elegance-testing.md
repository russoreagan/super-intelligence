# Aesthetic Elegance Testing

Complexity is the default outcome of design by committee, incremental revision, and
deference to edge cases. Each addition is locally defensible. The cumulative result is
a system no one would have designed on purpose. Elegance is not simplicity for its own
sake — it is the property of a solution where every element earns its place and nothing
obscures the core. This skill tests for that property.

## Your Process

**Step 1: State the Solution**
Describe the design, plan, system, or solution in enough detail to evaluate its parts.
If it's a process, name the steps. If it's a system, name the components. If it's a
strategy, name the moves.

**Step 2: Define the Irreducible Core**
What is the minimum that does the job? State in one sentence what the solution must
accomplish to succeed. Every element that doesn't directly serve this core is a
candidate for removal. If you can't state the core in one sentence, the solution may
not have one — which is itself a finding.

**Step 3: Element Audit**
For each component, mechanism, layer, or step: is it necessary for the core job, or
did it accrete over time to handle edge cases, satisfy stakeholder requests, hedge
against unlikely scenarios, or address problems that may not exist? Label each
clearly: **necessary** or **accreted**.

**Step 4: Concept Count**
How many distinct concepts must a new person learn to understand and use this
solution fully? Elegant solutions have fewer. Count them explicitly. Compare against
the irreducible minimum — the number of concepts required if every accreted element
were removed. The gap is the complexity overhead.

**Step 5: Thirty-Second Explanation Test**
Can you explain the solution in 30 seconds to someone intelligent but unfamiliar
with it? Attempt the explanation. If it requires more than 30 seconds, complexity
may be genuine — or it may be a sign the design hasn't been thought through clearly
enough to be simple. Both are worth knowing.

**Step 6: Sources of Unnecessary Complexity**
For each accreted element: what introduced it, and what would removing it cost? Some
removals are free — the element was pure noise. Some involve real trade-offs — the
element serves a secondary purpose worth naming. Distinguish them explicitly.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Accidental complexity only** — What could be removed without losing anything that matters
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

**Core Job:** [one sentence — what the solution must accomplish to succeed]

**Element Audit**

| Element | Necessary or Accreted | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| [component/mechanism/step] | [necessary / accreted] | [why it does or doesn't serve the core] |

**Concept Count:** [n currently required] vs [n at irreducible minimum] — overhead: [gap]
