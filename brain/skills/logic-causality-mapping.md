# Logic Causal Reasoning

Correlation isn't causation. Neither is sequence. "This happened, then that happened" is not the same as "this caused that" — but it's treated as equivalent constantly, and it produces wrong diagnoses, failed fixes, and surprised engineers.

This skill makes causal structure explicit: what actually depends on what, what change produces what effect, and what must be true for a plan to hold.

## Four Modes

Use the mode that matches the question.

### Mode 1: Root Cause Tracing
*"Why did this happen?"*

Work backwards from an observed effect to its cause — and to the cause of that cause.

**Process:**
1. State the observed effect precisely. Not "the system is slow" — "p95 latency increased from 120ms to 840ms after the Tuesday deploy."
2. Ask: what are the immediate causes that could produce this effect? List all plausible candidates.
3. For each candidate: what evidence would confirm or rule it out?
4. Eliminate candidates. For the survivors: what caused them?
5. Continue until you reach a cause that has no upstream cause within scope — or a point where further tracing requires different expertise or data.
6. Distinguish: **root cause** (the origin), **proximate cause** (the immediate trigger), **contributing factors** (conditions that allowed it).

### Mode 2: Impact Mapping
*"What breaks if I change X?"*

Work forwards from a proposed change through its downstream effects.

**Process:**
1. State the change precisely.
2. Identify direct dependents: what immediately relies on the thing being changed?
3. For each dependent: what behaviour changes, and what downstream systems rely on that behaviour?
4. Continue for two to three levels of dependency.
5. Mark irreversible effects — changes that, once made, cannot be cleanly undone.
6. Mark cascade risks — places where a small effect triggers a large one.

### Mode 3: Dependency Mapping
*"What must be true for this to work?"*

Identify the full set of conditions a plan depends on.

**Process:**
1. State the plan or goal.
2. Ask: what must be true in the environment for this to succeed? List all dependencies.
3. For each dependency: is it guaranteed, assumed, or unknown?
4. For each assumed dependency: what is the cost if the assumption is wrong?
5. Surface single points of failure — dependencies that, if they break, cause total plan failure with no fallback.

### Mode 4: Counterfactual Testing
*"Would Y still have happened without X?"*

Test a causal claim by reasoning about the counterfactual world.

**Process:**
1. State the causal claim: "X caused Y."
2. Imagine removing X. Would Y still happen via another path?
3. If yes: X is a contributing factor, not the root cause.
4. If no: X is necessary for Y — strong causal evidence.
5. Consider: was X sufficient alone, or did it require other conditions?

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Direct causes only** — Map first-order causal links, skip downstream consequences
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

**Mode:** [Root Cause / Impact Mapping / Dependency Mapping / Counterfactual]

**Question:** [the specific causal question being answered]

**[Mode-appropriate structure]**

For Root Cause:
- Proximate cause: [immediate trigger]
- Root cause: [origin]
- Contributing factors: [conditions that enabled it]
- Evidence: [what confirms this vs what was ruled out]

For Impact Mapping:
- Direct effects: [level 1 dependencies affected]
- Downstream effects: [level 2-3]
- Irreversible effects: [flagged]
- Cascade risks: [flagged]

For Dependency Mapping:
- Dependencies: [each, with status: guaranteed / assumed / unknown]
- Single points of failure: [flagged]
- Highest-risk assumptions: [ranked]

For Counterfactual:
- Causal claim tested: [X caused Y]
- Counterfactual: [would Y happen without X?]
- Verdict: [necessary / contributing / coincidental]
- Conditions required alongside X: [if X alone wasn't sufficient]

**Summary**
[2-3 sentences on what the causal analysis reveals and what action it implies]

## Notes

Causal reasoning is always provisional — it produces the best available model given current evidence, not a proof. State explicitly what evidence would change the analysis. In complex systems, multiple causal chains often contribute to a single effect; resist the urge to stop at the first plausible explanation.

- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/systems-feedback-mapping` — Turn the causal map into a feedback loop analysis
  - `/historical-precedent-analysis` — Check whether this causal chain has played out before
  - `/constraint-hardness-testing` — Test which causal link is the weakest and most brittle
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
