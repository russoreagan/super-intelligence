# Decision

Applies structured decision thinking to any choice. Diagnoses what kind of decision work is needed and applies the right tool.

## Which tool fits

| You need to... | Tool |
|---|---|
| Make sure you're seeing all the real options | option-mapping |
| Compare options against weighted criteria | criteria-weighting |
| Stress-test a decision by imagining it failed | premortem-analysis |
| Calibrate how much process this decision deserves | reversibility-analysis |

## Routing Decision

- **About to decide between 2 options — may be missing others** → option-mapping first
- **Options are visible, need to compare them systematically** → criteria-weighting
- **Leaning toward a direction, want to stress-test it** → premortem-analysis
- **Unsure how much time to spend on this decision** → reversibility-analysis
- **Unclear** → option-mapping; the option space is almost always narrower than it should be

## Option Mapping

*Ensures all real options are visible before choosing.*

Counter the false dichotomy: the first two options that come to mind are rarely all that exists. Generate options across three levels: (1) direct solutions to the stated problem, (2) alternative framings of the problem that suggest different solutions, (3) options that combine or transcend the initial set. Apply the deliberate quota: find at least 5 options. Don't evaluate until the inventory is complete.

**Output:** Option inventory (5+ minimum), including options that reframe the problem, with brief descriptions. No evaluation yet — just the full map.

## Criteria Weighting

*Runs a weighted multi-criteria analysis.*

Step 1: List what actually matters for this decision. Step 2: Weight each criterion by importance (1-5 scale). Step 3: Score each option on each criterion (1-5). Step 4: Calculate weighted scores. Step 5: Check the winner against intuition — if the numbers say X but your gut says Y, that gap is information worth understanding, not a flaw in the method.

**Output:** Weighted decision matrix, ranked options, and an interpretation of whether the quantitative result matches or challenges intuition.

## Premortem Analysis

*Imagines the decision was made and failed — then diagnoses why.*

Set the scene: it's 12 months from now. The decision was made, and it failed badly. Write the failure story: what went wrong? Be specific — not "it didn't work" but the actual mechanism of failure. Generate 5+ distinct failure paths. Now: which failure modes are most probable? Which are most damaging if they occur? Which can be mitigated before committing?

**Output:** 5+ failure paths, ranked by probability and severity. For each high-priority failure mode: the mitigation that reduces it. The adjusted decision recommendation.

## Reversibility Analysis

*Categorises a decision by reversibility to apply the right level of process.*

Two-way door decisions (easily reversible) should be made quickly with less process — the cost of deliberating exceeds the cost of being wrong. One-way door decisions (hard or impossible to reverse) deserve thorough analysis. Classify this decision: what would it take to undo it? How quickly? At what cost? Many decisions that feel irreversible aren't. Many that feel casual are more binding than they appear.

**Output:** Decision classification (reversibility score 1-5), what undoing it would require, and the recommended level of process given that classification.
