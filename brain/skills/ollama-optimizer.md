# Ollama Optimizer

Optimize Ollama configuration based on system hardware analysis.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to optimize Ollama, configure Ollama, speed up Ollama, fix Ollama running slow, set up a local LLM, tune inference speed, reduce memory usage, or select models that fit their GPU/RAM. The skill analyzes hardware (GPU, VRAM, RAM, CPU) and produces tailored recommendations.

Do not use for LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, or hosted-API LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) — those use different runtimes and tuning surfaces.

## Repo Sync Before Edits (mandatory)

Before creating/updating/deleting files in an existing repository, sync the current branch with remote:

```bash
branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
git fetch origin
git pull --rebase origin "$branch"
```

If the working tree is not clean, stash first, sync, then restore:

```bash
git stash push -u -m "pre-sync"
branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
git fetch origin && git pull --rebase origin "$branch"
git stash pop
```

If `origin` is missing, pull is unavailable, or rebase/stash conflicts occur, stop and ask the user before continuing.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: System Detection

Run the detection script to gather hardware information:

```bash
python3 scripts/detect_system.py
```

Parse the JSON output to identify:
- OS and version
- CPU model and core count
- Total RAM / unified memory
- GPU type, VRAM, and driver version
- Current Ollama installation and environment variables

### Phase 2: Analyze and Recommend

Based on detected hardware, determine the optimization profile:

**Hardware Tier Classification:**

| Tier | Criteria | Max Model | Key Optimizations |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| CPU-only | No GPU detected | 3B | num_thread tuning, Q4_K_M quant |
| Low VRAM | <6GB VRAM | 3B | Flash attention, KV cache q4_0 |
| Entry | 6-8GB VRAM | 8B | Flash attention, KV cache q8_0 |
| Prosumer | 10-12GB VRAM | 14B | Flash attention, full offload |
| Workstation | 16-24GB VRAM | 32B | Standard config, Q5_K_M option |
| High-end | 48GB+ VRAM | 70B+ | Multiple models, Q5/Q6 quants |

**Apple Silicon Special Case:**
- Unified memory = shared CPU/GPU RAM
- 8GB Mac → treat as 6GB VRAM tier
- 16GB Mac → treat as 12GB VRAM tier
- 32GB+ Mac → treat as workstation tier

### Phase 3: Generate Optimization Plan

Create a structured optimization guide with these sections:

#### 1. System Overview
Present detected hardware specs and highlight constraints (e.g., "8GB unified memory limits to 7B models").

#### 2. Dependency Assessment
List what's needed based on the platform:
- macOS: Ollama only (Metal automatic)
- Linux NVIDIA: Ollama + NVIDIA driver 450+
- Linux AMD: Ollama + ROCm 5.0+
- Windows: Ollama + NVIDIA driver 452+

#### 3. Configuration Recommendations

**Essential environment variables:**
```bash
# Always recommended
export OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1

# Memory-constrained systems (<12GB)
export OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0  # or q4_0 for severe constraints
```

**Model selection guidance:**
- Recommend specific models from `ollama list` output
- Suggest appropriate quantization (Q4_K_M default, Q5_K_M if headroom exists)
- Warn if current models exceed hardware capacity

**Modelfile tuning (when needed):**
```
PARAMETER num_gpu <layers>    # Partial offload for limited VRAM
PARAMETER num_thread <cores>  # CPU threads (physical cores, not hyperthreads)
PARAMETER num_ctx <size>      # Reduce context for memory savings
```

#### 4. Execution Checklist
Provide copy-paste commands in order:
1. Set environment variables
2. Restart Ollama service
3. Pull recommended models
4. Test with `ollama run <model> --verbose`

#### 5. Verification Commands

```bash
# Benchmark current performance
python3 scripts/benchmark_ollama.py --model <model>
# Expected output: tokens/s and generation latency. Compare against tier baseline from Phase 2.

# Check GPU memory usage (NVIDIA)
nvidia-smi

# Verify config is applied
ollama run <model> "test" --verbose 2>&1 | head -20
```

## Acceptance Criteria

A run passes when **all** of the following are true:

- [ ] Hardware tier (CPU-only / Low-VRAM / Entry / Prosumer / Workstation / High-end) is identified explicitly in the report.
- [ ] Recommended model size fits within detected VRAM/unified-memory budget (no recommending a 14B model on an 8GB Mac).
- [ ] Required Ollama environment variables (e.g., `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION`, KV-cache quantisation) are written to a shell init file the user actually uses, with a backup of the prior file.
- [ ] Apple Silicon special case is applied when detected — unified memory is not double-counted as separate VRAM + RAM.
- [ ] Verification step runs `ollama run <model>` with `--verbose` and captures the actual offload/cache numbers.
- [ ] Rollback instructions are included so the user can revert all env changes with one command.

## Step Completion Reports

After completing each major step, output a status report in this format:

```
◆ [Step Name] ([step N of M] — [context])
··································································
  [Check 1]:          √ pass
  [Check 2]:          √ pass (note if relevant)
  [Check 3]:          × fail — [reason]
  [Check 4]:          √ pass
  [Criteria]:         √ N/M met
  ____________________________
  Result:             PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
```

Adapt the check names to match what the step actually validates. Use `√` for pass, `×` for fail, and `—` to add brief context. The "Criteria" line summarizes how many acceptance criteria were met. The "Result" line gives the overall verdict.
