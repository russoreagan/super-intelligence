description: "Entry point for the probability toolkit. Routes to the right probabilistic thinking skill based on your situation. Use when you say 'probability', 'how likely', 'am I overconfident', 'quantify this', 'what's the base rate', 'expected value', 'scenario weighting', or want probabilistic reasoning applied without knowing which specific tool fits."

# Probability

Applies probabilistic thinking to estimates, decisions, and uncertainty. Diagnoses what kind of probability work is needed and applies the right tool.

## Which tool fits

| You need to... | Tool |
|---|---|
| Anchor estimates in historical base rates before adjusting | base-rate-anchoring |
| Test whether stated confidence matches available evidence | confidence-calibration |
| Calculate expected value to compare options under uncertainty | expected-value-calculation |
| Assign probabilities to distinct scenarios before deciding | scenario-weighting |

## Routing Decision

- **Estimate feels optimistic — want the outside view** → base-rate-anchoring
- **Unsure how confident to be, or whether confidence is warranted** → confidence-calibration
- **Comparing options with different payoffs and probabilities** → expected-value-calculation
- **Multiple plausible futures and need to think through each** → scenario-weighting
- **Unclear** → confidence-calibration; establishing what confidence is warranted usually determines what other analysis is needed

## Base Rate Anchoring

*Anchors estimates in historical base rates before adjusting for specifics.*

Before adjusting for what makes this situation special, establish what usually happens in situations like this one. Find the reference class: what category of event is this? What is the historical base rate for that category? Now adjust: what specific factors make this situation better or worse than the reference class? The adjustment should be modest unless the specific factors are genuinely exceptional; most people underweight the base rate and overweight the specifics.

**Output:** Reference class identified, base rate established, specific adjustments with justification, and the final calibrated estimate.

## Confidence Calibration

*Tests whether stated confidence levels match available evidence.*

State the current confidence level. Now audit it: what is the evidence for this belief? How strong is that evidence? What evidence against have you considered? Are you more confident than the evidence warrants (overconfidence — common) or less confident than it warrants (underconfidence — less common but real)? Good calibration means your 80% confident predictions come true about 80% of the time.

**Output:** Confidence audit — evidence for, evidence against, sources of overconfidence, and a recalibrated confidence level with reasoning.

## Expected Value Calculation

*Calculates expected value to compare options under uncertainty.*

For each option: list possible outcomes and their probabilities. Estimate the value (positive or negative) of each outcome. Calculate expected value: sum(probability × value) for each outcome. Compare across options. Identify if any option has asymmetric risk — limited downside, large upside — which expected value captures but intuition often misses.

**Output:** Expected value calculation for each option, comparison table, and interpretation of the asymmetry or risk profile.

## Scenario Weighting

*Assigns explicit probabilities to distinct scenarios before making a decision.*

Define 3-5 mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive scenarios for how this situation could unfold. For each scenario: what are the key conditions that make it happen? Assign a probability to each (they must sum to 100%). For each scenario: what decision is optimal? Now aggregate: given the scenario probabilities, what is the best overall decision?

**Output:** Scenario inventory with probabilities, optimal decision per scenario, and the overall recommendation weighted by scenario probabilities.
