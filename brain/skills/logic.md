# Logic

Applies logical analysis to arguments, plans, reasoning, and systems. Diagnoses what kind of logical work is needed and applies the right tool.

## Which tool fits

| You need to... | Tool |
|---|---|
| Full council pressure-test with peer review | logic-council |
| Fast comprehensive logic report | logic-check |
| Validate whether premises support a conclusion | argument-validation |
| Find internal contradictions in a document or spec | consistency-check |
| Map causal relationships and dependencies | causality-mapping |
| Map the constraint landscape for a decision or plan | constraint-mapping |
| Fix broken reasoning — not just diagnose, but repair | logic-fixer |

## Routing Decision

- **Complex argument worth thorough pressure-testing** → logic-council (multi-advisor + peer review)
- **Need a complete logic review quickly** → logic-check (all dimensions, no overhead)
- **Specific argument with a conclusion that needs validating** → argument-validation
- **Document or spec that might contain contradictions** → consistency-check
- **Need to understand what causes what, or what breaks if X changes** → causality-mapping
- **Unclear what's actually negotiable or fixed in a situation** → constraint-mapping
- **Have broken reasoning and want it repaired** → logic-fixer
- **Unclear** → logic-check (comprehensive starting point that surfaces which deeper tool is needed)

## Logic Check

*Fast comprehensive logic report on any argument, plan, or reasoning.*

Apply a complete logical assessment in a single pass: (1) Premises — are they stated clearly and are they true? (2) Inference — do the conclusions actually follow from the premises? (3) Fallacies — which informal fallacies (if any) are present? (4) Hidden assumptions — what unstated premises is the reasoning relying on? (5) Verdict — is this reasoning sound, and if not, what specifically is wrong?

**Output:** Five-section assessment with a final verdict: sound / unsound with specific diagnosis.

---

## Logic Council

*Full five-advisor reasoning council — use for complex arguments where the conclusion matters.*

See `logic-council` for the full multi-agent process with 5 independent reasoning framework advisors, peer review, and chair synthesis. Route here when the argument is complex, has non-obvious dependencies, or is reasoning you've invested in and want stress-tested by independent perspectives.

---

## Argument Validation

*Checks whether an argument's premises support its conclusion.*

Identify the argument structure: premises → conclusion. Test each premise: is it true, and does the argument assume it without justification? Test the inference: do the premises actually entail the conclusion, or is there a gap? Identify any logical fallacies present. Distinguish between deductive validity (the structure holds) and soundness (the premises are also true).

**Output:** Argument map (premises, inference, conclusion), validity assessment, soundness assessment, fallacies identified, and the specific repair needed.

---

## Consistency Check

*Surfaces internal contradictions in a document, spec, or plan.*

Read for conflict, not comprehension. For each claim or requirement: does any other part of the document contradict it? Are there requirements that can't all be satisfied simultaneously? Are there edge cases that expose a hidden conflict? Documents that grew incrementally frequently have internal contradictions that no single author introduced but no one caught.

**Output:** Contradictions inventory, classified by severity (surface vs. structural), with specific locations and suggested resolutions.

---

## Causality Mapping

*Maps causal relationships, traces dependencies, and reasons about consequences.*

Build the causal chain: A causes B because [mechanism]. B enables/requires C. If X changes, what else must change? What has to be true for the plan to work — what are the causal prerequisites? Where are the dependencies that, if broken, break everything downstream? Causal maps reveal the leverage points and the fragile assumptions.

**Output:** Causal chain diagram (in text), key dependencies, critical path, and the assumptions the whole structure rests on.

---

## Constraint Mapping

*Maps the full constraint landscape for a decision, design, or plan.*

Inventory all constraints: (1) Classify each as hard (physical/legal), soft (organizational/political), or assumed (may not be real). (2) Find conflicts between constraints — requirements that can't all be satisfied. (3) Find the constraint boundary — the actual solution space that remains. (4) Identify which constraints, if relaxed, would most expand the solution space.

**Output:** Constraint inventory classified by type, conflict map, solution space definition, and highest-value constraints to challenge.

---

## Logic Fixer

*Takes broken reasoning and produces a corrected version.*

Diagnose the specific failure: which premise is false? Where does the inference fail? What fallacy is present? What's the circular dependency? Then repair: restate the argument in a form that is valid, where every premise is defensible and the conclusion actually follows. The goal is not just to identify what's wrong — it's to produce reasoning that works.

**Output:** Diagnosis of the specific logical failure(s). Repaired argument that is valid and sound. If the conclusion cannot be saved, a clear statement of what conclusion *is* supportable.
