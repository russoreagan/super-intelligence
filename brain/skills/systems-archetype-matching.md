# Systems Archetype Matching

Recurring system behaviors are not unique — they follow a small set of structural patterns that have known causes and known high-leverage responses. Senge's eight archetypes give names to these patterns. Matching the current situation to an archetype tells you what structure is producing the behavior and what intervention actually works, rather than re-discovering the same solution each cycle.

---

## Your Process

**Step 1: Describe the Recurring Behavior**
State what keeps happening. Include: what was tried, what temporarily worked, what came back. The more specific, the better the match.

**Step 2: Compare Against All Eight Archetypes**
Screen each archetype:
- **Limits to Growth:** growth slows unexpectedly as a constraint is hit
- **Shifting the Burden:** symptomatic fix used repeatedly, undermining fundamental solution
- **Eroding Goals:** goals lowered to close the gap instead of improving performance
- **Escalation:** two parties each respond to the other's actions by increasing their own
- **Success to the Successful:** winner gets more resources, making it harder for others to compete
- **Tragedy of the Commons:** shared resource overused because individual gain exceeds individual cost
- **Fixes that Fail:** short-term fix has delayed negative side effects that recreate the problem
- **Growth and Underinvestment:** growth slows because capacity investment lags demand

**Step 3: Select the Best Match**
Choose the archetype whose causal structure most closely matches the described situation. Note any secondary archetypes.

**Step 4: Map the Situation Onto the Archetype**
Translate the archetype's generic variables into the specific people, resources, decisions, and feedback loops of this situation.

**Step 5: Apply the Standard Intervention**
Each archetype has a known high-leverage response. State it for this situation specifically.

## Human Check-in

Before proceeding, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool:

- **Question:** "How do you want to run this?"
- **Header:** "Scope"
- **Options:**
  - **Full analysis** — Complete all steps, reasoning shown throughout
  - **Key findings only** — Bottom-line output, skip step-by-step detail
  - **Archetype identification only** — Name the recurring system pattern, skip full dynamics analysis
  - **Refine the framing** — Adjust what we're analyzing before starting

Proceed based on their selection.

## Output Format

**Archetype Match:** [archetype name] (secondary: [if any])

**Why It Matches:** [2–3 sentences mapping behavior to archetype structure]

**Situation Mapped to Archetype Structure**

| Archetype Variable | This Situation |
|-------------------|---------------|
| | |

**Standard Intervention:** [what actually works for this archetype, made specific to this situation]

**What to Stop Doing:** [the low-leverage or counterproductive response the archetype predicts]

## Notes

If two archetypes both fit, that is meaningful — overlapping archetypes indicate a more entrenched structure. Apply the higher-leverage archetype's intervention first.

## What's Next

After delivering this output, use `AskUserQuestion` to offer the next move:

- **Question:** "Archetype matched. What's next?"
- **Header:** "Next"
- **Options:**
  - `/systems-leverage-analysis` — Find leverage points within the matched archetype
  - `/systems-feedback-mapping` — Map feedback loops specific to the archetype
  - `/historical-precedent-analysis` — Find historical precedents for this archetype
  - **Done** — Wrap up and synthesise what we have so far
